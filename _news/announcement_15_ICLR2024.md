[Mike Lasby's](/labmembers/) collaborative work with researchers at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google), [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai), ["Dynamic Sparse Training with Structured Sparsity"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kOBkxFRKTA) {% cite lasby2024srigl %}, was accepted at the [International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024)! DST methods learn state-of-the-art sparse masks, but accelerating DNNs with unstructured masks is difficult. SRigL learns structured masks, improving real-world CPU/GPU timings!
